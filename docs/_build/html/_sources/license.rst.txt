Frequently Asked Questions
================================================================================

Can I use rax25kb commercially?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. GPL allows commercial use. You may charge for services (installation,
support, hosting) but not for the software itself, and you must provide
source code to recipients.

Do I need to share my configuration files?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Configuration files are not derivative works and are not covered by GPL.

Can I link rax25kb with proprietary software?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, no. GPL requires the combined work to be GPL. However:

* Communication through standard protocols (TCP) is not linking
* You can use rax25kb as a separate program
* Consult a lawyer for specific situations

Can I relicense rax25kb?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, unless you are the copyright holder. GPL requires derivative works to
remain GPL. You may only offer "or later" GPL versions.

What if I violate the GPL?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Your GPL license terminates automatically
* Copyright holder may take legal action
* You can cure violation by coming into compliance
* Persistent violations may result in permanent termination

Can I use a different license for my fork?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Derivative works must be licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. You may add
"or later" but cannot change to a different license.
