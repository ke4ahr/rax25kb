# rax25kb Configuration Example - Single TNC
# Version: 1.7.3
#
# This is a configuration for bridging a dual port KISS TNC to one TCP
# server, e.g.: Kantronics KPC-9612. The older KPC-9612s support 300 -
# 19200 bps. Newer firmware supports 38400 as well. 
#
# Flow control isn't used for KISS. It is typically implemented in the
# schematics of diode matrixes, however it is not specified in the
# standard. 
#
# Back in the 'bad old days', we had to configure a serial KISS TNC
# in xNOS, then use a funky "attach ax0 kiss 1 ax1" type of command.
# The unstated thing here is that KISS, by itself, includes the
# addressing of XKISS, but ignores it. Most of the serial program
# interfaces like BPQ32, etc. tend to pass all KISS traffic on the
# serial port to the TCP port so by default additional TNCs can be
# addressed over the same TCP session or connection.
#
# rax25kb has that ability.  It can also filter the additonal
# channels and/or redirect them to another configured TCP listener. 
#
# The general philospohy is that you can make it as complicated as
# you want and only CPU, serial ports, etc. are your limits.
#
# Kenwood TS-2000 will want 2 stop bits at 4800 bps no matter what.
